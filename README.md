Background:
Enacted by Congress in 2020 to respond to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Paycheck Protection Program provided nearly $800 billion in loans to small businesses in order to retain payrolls. The Small Business Administration has oversight over the PPP program, although the loans are administered by private lenders, who then submit application information to the government. The loans could be fully forgiven if certain conditions were met.
* The SBA has periodically released data on the more than 11.5 million approved applications, but it also has removed applications that had been previously present in the dataset.
* The SBA has not offered publicly a reason for the removal of these applications, although some theories seem reasonable to consider.

Analyzing the ppp data, we succefully develope a clear understanding of why these loans might have been removed.
Building predictive models, we are able to predict whether a loan will be removed based on features in the ppp dataset.
